# Application Initialization

To use this application you should have `node` and `npm` installed and issue the following commands:

1. `npm install`: this will install the required `node` libraries.
2. `npm run buildDev`: this will compile the application code and produce a `dist` directory. Compresses JS files into main.js and links to html files.
3. `npm start`: this will run the Express server, `server.js`, allowing you to view the running application in the browser window.
